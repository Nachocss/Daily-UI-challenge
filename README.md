# Daily UI challenge

Daily UI is a series of daily design challenges design inspiration. You can found them in www.dailyui.co

###### My goal on this challenge is not only to practice UX/UI design but also learn Flutter features. Some days, there could be more focus on one of that than on the another. Warning, you might encounter bad coding practices.

## Day 001
Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.

## Day 002
Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.

## Day 003
What's the main focus? Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a product? Consider important landing page elements (call-to-actions, clarity, etc.)

## Day 004
Design a calculator. Standard, scientific, or specialty calculator for something such as a mortgage? Is it for a phone, a tablet, a web app?
